<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Next week, I&rsquo;m finally heading to Kilimanjaro. We&rsquo;re taking on the 8-day Lemosho route, and I&rsquo;m both excited and nervous about what lies ahead.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do my best to post updates along the way if network coverage allows. If not, I will do a full recap once I&rsquo;m back home with stories to tell.</p>
<p>For now, I wanted to share my packing list with you. Over the past few months, I&rsquo;ve poured over countless blogs and YouTube videos from fellow trekkers, gathering insights and learning from their experiences. This post is my way of paying it forward—hoping it might help someone else preparing for their own Kilimanjaro adventure.</p>
<p>Below is everything I&rsquo;ve packed for this 8-day journey. I&rsquo;ve tried to strike a balance between being prepared and not overpacking (though I suspect I may have erred on the side of caution).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gear List Kilimanjaro - 8 day trek.pdf<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re planning your own trek or just curious about what it takes to climb Africa&rsquo;s highest peak, I hope this list gives you some useful insights. Wish me luck—I have a feeling I&rsquo;m going to need it!</p>

			 <p>This week mom had her birthday and we had planned a dinner with a view of the pyramids. We were then invited to a dinner that the new ambassador was hosting for a colleague who was leaving Cairo. We tried to excuse ourselves, but upon insistence we chose to attend.</p>
<p>To our surprise, they had bought a cake for mom and we had a full celebration around it. We were all touched by the very thoughtful and warm gesture. Mom was also quite moved, because over the years we have toned down our celebrations to quiet little cozy meals, and this was a good surprise for her as well.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a long time we got to catch up on a couple of movies last week. One of them was a Telugu movie called Court.</p>
<p>It is a very well written and acted court room drama. It was very a satisfying watch. The sensitivity and the tenderness of young love, the establishing of the nastiness of the villain character were all so well written, that they make you feel the characters.</p>
<p>The entire drama is very routed in the milieu. It is a wonderful watch and I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>After reaching <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Fox Camp<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where a guide was arranged for me to take me up the mountains and bring me back. The hike was supposed to start at 10am, but guide had some transportation issues and we eventually started out at 11.45am. Not the ideal time to start a hike, but if I had to return the next day, this was the only option. Coincidentally my guide was named Musa (Moses) as well.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The terrain was very different and I huffed and puffed for a while until I found my rhythm. I had to remind myself that I need not race or do this fast. The aim was to do it and come back without an injury. And I think this would be the mantra for Kilimanjaro as well — <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pole, pole <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Swahili for slowly slowly)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Couple of hours later, we reached the valley where would be resting later in the night. The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Wadi <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(valley) was a little green pasture were a few families were doing farming. The fertile piece of land was a welcome sight for the dry features around it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We unloaded a lot of our stuff, took only water and snacks and started up Mt. Katherine after a very short break. The  way up was daunting to say the least, but I had to do this to see how I would be able to hold up in Kilimanjaro.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By this time my shoulders were aching, which I later realized was because of me not swinging my arms. And walking 4h straight was causing cramps all over — quads, adductors, hamstrings. Musa, my guide, was very supportive and kept the spirits up. He even helped me stretch my hamstrings, when it was cramping real bad.</p>
<p>We finally reached the summit just after sunset. But the twilight was such a wonderful sight.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a short 20 minute rest, we started walking back down again. Not sure whether it was the adrenaline from summiting or just gravity, the walk down felt refreshing and easy on effort. The knees and the ankles begged to differ though!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They had provided me a room with just a mattress on the floor and some blankets. I was more than happy to have it in this wilderness. I just crashed after a few quick stretches.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The next morning, I was well rested and felt that I have a new pair of legs. </p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We started the hike at 5.20am and reached the summit in about 2h without a stop. I think the body was getting used to the rhythm by now and I realized that walking slow in Zone 2 heart rate, helped me walked longer without gassing myself at the end of the hike.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By the time I summited, the tourists who had done the night trek to view the sunrise had left and I had the summit all to myself. We had some nice breakfast at the top. I was able to do a video call with the folks back home. </p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After resting for about an hour, we started walking back down to Fox Camp.</p>
<p>My guide said he had a different path planned for me, instead of the usual ones that tourists took. We stopped by Elijah&rsquo;s garden and crossed a mountain from there to join the path we took the previous night.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally after 3.5h, we reached Fox garden at about the same time we started from there the previous day. Mission accomplished!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a quick shower and a quick lunch, I started back to Cairo.</p>

			 <p>I loved this post from Ashley Willis-McNamara, on writing about on the internet. As she rightly guessed, I was nodding along as I read it. There are so many parts that resonated with me. I have changed too. I used to be prolific on Facebook, then Instagram and then Twitter. But along the way, life happened, things changed. I switched to Fediverse and finally decided to setup a home at jrr.digial, running on Micro.Blog.</p>
<p>For a while, I was active, then I have just been reading but not writing. But Ashley has convinced me to write again. Glad to have reminders like this once in a while. Thank you Ashley!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When we moved to Cairo and were in the processing of settling down and we would want to wind down with some TV series that would take our brain off the crazy days we were having. That is when I came across The Rookie. We love Nathan Fillion from the days of <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1419-castle">Castle</a> and so we started with the pilot episode.</p>
<p>And soon we got hooked on to it and soon we became fans of the show. The writing was sharp, the woman characters has a strong personality, the show had a good moral compass and the jokes were 🤌🏽.</p>
<p>Soon Netflix let us know that they have the show only till Dec 31st. We didn&rsquo;t want to let go of what we had and binge on all the episodes we could lay our hands on. After years, we were back to binge watching 2-3 episodes a day! The cold winters in Cairo helped too in us cozing up in the TV room!</p>
<p>And do we finished 5 seasons in a record time. The last we watched a TV series in such a record speed was for <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/4046-spooks">Spooks</a>.</p>

<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593135204">Project Hail Mary: A Novel</a> by Weir, Andy 📚</p>
<p>It has been a while since I last read a full book. I have been dropping books mid-way mostly or have kept them pending for years now. 🙈</p>
<p>In that sense, this happened pretty quickly. Apart from the wonderful storyline it was mostly because it was loaned from a library. The added pressure definitely helped. Hope this turns out to a reading streak. 🤞🏼</p>

			 <p>An very level headed take on the WPEngine and Matt Mullenweg controversy. I am also a little disappointed with Matt and where this is headed, but this post is a good reminder that we are all human and mistakes are a part of us. Mistakes alone should not define us. I too hope Matt does better on this issue and in the future!</p>

			 <p>Finally after being here in Egypt for 3 weeks, we got some breathing time this weekend to go around sightseeing in Cairo. And what better way to start than a boat ride on the Nile.</p>
<p>We went to the eastern bank of the Nile and entered the promenade called <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rio3WRRtCJyoaF637">Mamsha Ahl Misr 📍</a>. There was an entry fee of EGP 20. The walkway was very well maintained and it was a pleasure to be walking along the river that was majestically flowing through the city.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The promenade is fully of cafes and restaurants, all of them having a stunning view of the river. We had our evening coffee before heading for the boats.</p>
<p>The boat rides cost differently not just based on the type, but from which place you take it from. We took a sharing boat ride, which was fun except for the loud music. The locals on the boat where enjoying it, so we guess it is a thing here.</p>

			 <p>It is almost a week since we landed in Cairo. The journey here was made memorable thanks to Emirates. They totally pampered #OhBoy with toys, activity books, Polaroid shots and special meals etc. Also this was his first flight with in-flight entertainment. He was beyond thrilled.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This was our first view of Cairo. A total contrast to what we have been used to in KL. This is not a complaint by any means, just an observation. #OhBoy was quick to provide his approval!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We have a temporary accommodation in one of the downtown areas and the chaos on the streets is both beautiful and overwhelming. I guess the city will slowly grow on us. As of now, we are mostly silently observing it and hopefully soon we will contribute to some of this chaos :)</p>
<p>There is a thin (sometimes thick) layer of dust on every building, tree or anything outside. Beneath it everyday life moves on with so much gusto! A great metaphor for life. It will take a while for me to get used to the dust, coming from Malaysia. But I cannot wait to become a part of Cairo and Cairo to become a part of us!</p>

			 <p>We wrapped up our stay in Malaysia yesterday after <a href="https://jrr.digital/2024/07/03/our-stay-in.html">3 years of stay here</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the end things became crazy busy with some unplanned hospital visits, sales of cars, farewell visits from friends etc. We were wrapped up in a warm feeling of care and affection from friends who made sure we were fed after our kitchen was packed, made the effort to travel from afar to meet us one last time and stood with us till we left in the van to the airport. We felt blessed to have them all in our lives.</p>
<p>So long Malaysia! I am really hoping of coming back here and checking off the list of pending things to do.</p>
<p>Before hopping on to the flight, we had our one last fix of Kopi along with a butter toast and egg custard tart at the Oriental Kopi at KLIA2. You can see #OhBoy give his sign of approval. We left KL with a smile on our lips!

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The last couple of weeks have been hectic on the #parenting front. One day #OhBoy retuned back unwell from school. We initially thought it was just a simple stomach bug, as he had a temperature along with it. Soon the temperature  came down and all the tests came out negative as well. He slowly recovered and we never knew what was the cause.</p>
<p>So after a week, we went to a friend&rsquo;s place for dinner. He was his normal self, but then eventually he refused to have dinner and said his tummy is aching. I got him back home and put him to sleep. By this time he was crying and it was a long night. He would wake up every hour and complain about the aching tummy and then go back to sleep. The whole night was this in repeat mode. At times he would be sobbing without actually calling and waking us up. It was sad to see him like that and tough when as a parent you can’t do anything to provide relief. In the morning he eventually pooped and was a different person after that. That is when it hit us that he could be constipated.</p>
<p>But then he was regular with his bowel movements and after an earlier warning from the paediatrician we always keep an eye on his toilet habits and spoke to him about it as well. So we were not sure what exactly it was this time.</p>
<p>We eventually got an appointment with the doctor and did a few tests to reveal that it was a case of paediatric constipation. The doctor said that it was pretty common among children. He is now on a bunch of medication to ease things out for him. Finally the pains have gone away and we are back to a regular schedule.</p>
<p>Below are my notes on things we need to do as parents to reduce such incidents. #OhBoy was doing most of this already. The only area he was slipping was withholding during playtime at school. And that eventually triggered all of this.</p>
<h2 id="notes-on-paediatric-constipation">Notes on paediatric constipation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Constipation is when either child does not pass stools or the stool is very hard and large</li>
<li>The symptoms for this are
<ul>
<li>less than 3 bowel movements a week</li>
<li>dry and hard stools that are painful to pass</li>
<li>bloated with abdominal pains</li>
<li>stomach pains that improve after they poop</li>
<li>traces of liquid or pasty stool in the underwear</li>
<li>blood on stool</li>
<li>poops like pellets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The cause for this could be any of the following
<ul>
<li>Diet — lack of fiber, not having enough fluids, more junk food, lots of daily products (Cheese, milk)</li>
<li>Lack of physical activity</li>
<li>Withholding (due to involvement in play or hesitation to use the toilets)</li>
<li>Emotional — Stress in family/life</li>
<li>Busy children — Who ignore body signals for want to play, too packed schedule</li>
<li>Underlying physical condition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changes to reduce such occurrences
<ul>
<li>Change in diet to include more fiber (Fruits, vegetables)</li>
<li>Intake lot of fluids</li>
<li>Get more exercise or physical activity</li>
<li>Good toilet habits — twice a day sitting on the toilet for 10 minutes, approximately 30 mins after a meal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

			 <p>With our <a href="https://jrr.digital/2024/07/03/our-stay-in.html">stay in KL is getting to an end soon</a>, we are starting to have goodbye meals with friends. A few weeks ago, we hosted our Chinese neighbour for a lunch at an Indian restaurant here. During that lunch, their son was reminiscing about the Vadai he had in our place, so we followed it up by a breakfast of Vadai, Idly and Dosai another day.</p>
<p>As conversations flowed in different directions that morning, we talked about Mala cuisine and about a lovely chilli chicken we had in one of the places here in KL. They quickly said that we have to try this place in Pudu, where the lady who cooks is from China and makes some fantastic food. So we went there this weekend. What a wonderful meal it turned out to be.</p>
<p>The highlight was the sour and spicy fish. The fish was fried and later a flavourful broth was added. That broth was just divine. We drank bowls of it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Pork was also good — so soft, garlicky and spicy as well</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There were other dishes like Prawns, Cabbage Sautee, Potato fry, spiced cucumber and the Chilli Chicken we came for. But the chicken was fried too dry and tough for our taste. The sichuan peppers though on it, were fun to eat ;)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We followed it up with some desserts. There were all made from paste of different nuts or seeds. We had one cup each of Black Sesame, Peanut, Almond and Walnut. I loved the Peanut and Black Sesame one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>#OhBoy was playing well with them all through and was a jester making up jokes and silly games. As our time here in KL is coming to end, I am slowly realising the so many things and people I will miss about this place. But I am glad to be leaving with so many wonderful memories!</p>

			 <p>This morning <em>The Missus</em> had to participate at a Yoga event a part of her official duties. We joined in as well. We stayed after the event to watch few of the games in the Sports Day of the school. One of them was an racing event for children with special needs and those in the autistic spectrum. Each child had a teacher or a volunteer helping them and it was nice to see these kids included as part of the Sports Day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We were told that the school has a couple of teachers for children with special needs and when such events happen, teachers from other schools pitch in to help them. And we were told it was a Malaysian government initiative. It is good to see some thought gone in for the needs of these children, rather than them being just an after thought. Can more be done? Sure. But kudos for the steps already taken!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We watched the series finale of Good Doctor a couple of days ago. We started watching this after we finished watching <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1408-house">House</a>. Both were created by David Shore.</p>
<p>We in general are suckers for good episodic drama be it either in medical or legal. So it was no surprise that we gravitated towards this. Also unlike House, the approach is all positive and has less sarcasm and meanness. So it made the watch all more fun.</p>
<p>They would regularly kill off characters and bring in new ones. But then it helped the plot move in new directions and kept the story fresh. While talking of characters, I want to quickly mention about the lead character Dr. Shaun Murphy played by Freddie Highmore. This is one of the finest performances of someone in the autistic spectrum, by someone who is neurotypical.</p>
<p>When the series finale started, I was wondering aloud how would they wrap it up. But then towards the end I realised, if writers wanted to they could bring any series to an end at any time. Here they brought the plot to some cliffhangers, cut to “10 years later” and neatly tied it all up. In an way I appreciate showrunners letting a show end when they don’t have any thing new to add!</p>

			 <h2 id="our-stay-in-malaysia-will-end-soon">Our stay in Malaysia will end soon</h2>
<p>After 3 years in Kuala Lumpur, it’s time to move again. By the end of this quarter we would be shifting to Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>Before moving to KL, I was a bit apprehensive about this place. We were relatively new parents still and we were anxious of how #OhBoy will adapt to this place.</p>
<p>But all it took was just the first day and I was so happy by the amount of greenery around, the cleaner air and evening showers! Everywhere we went we would keep commenting about the amount of vegetation was around and how much we will miss it when we leave Malaysia.</p>
<p>We always felt at home here. The food and culture, all felt familiar to our South Indian palate and we could get by as locals without attracting any attention of being a foreigner.</p>
<p>We got to travel around and have wonderful memories of the various visits we did. When we started, we hoped to visit all the 13 states and 3 federal territories during our stay. And as of today we stand at 10 states and 2 federal territories. Not a bad score and I hope we get to visit one more state before we bid adieu.</p>
<p>KL is where #OhBoy started his schooling. He transformed from not knowing any English to conversing only in English, that too with a Malay accent and “lah” and “already” thrown in as much as possible. He will miss Malaysia much  more than us. We have been constantly talking about the movement to Cairo, to reduce the separation anxiety that will happen when we move.</p>
<p>The thing I will personally miss the most, is the hikes that I get to do around each week here in KL. I started this fairly late in our 2nd year of stay and since then have been regular at it. I just wish I had started earlier.</p>
<p>I keep telling my wife that if there was an option to retire outside of India, I would choose Malaysia over any other place — good weather, lots of nature, relatively lower living costs and good medical facilities.</p>
<p>Hope to make the most of the next couple of months here!</p>

<p>After a while I got bored of walking in the cemented path and got into one of the trails that was marked for mountain bikes. That lead me to one of the many inner trails for hikes. I took the &ldquo;green&rdquo; trail to the peak. It was a nice walk through the trees. I was alone on this trail and had the forest for myself 😍!!</p>

			 <h2 id="ohboy-turned-5">#OhBoy turned 5!</h2>
<p>When we told #OhBoy that it was June 1st, he was thrilled that it was his birthday month. Everyday since he started doing a count down for his big day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Finally last week #OhBoy turned 5! We had a small celebration at our home, followed by one at his school. We adults stopped celebrating our birthdays a while ago, but now we get to vicariously celebrate through him.</p>
<p>To have seen him grow from a hapless little being to one who constantly questions and challenges you on every damn thing, has been a wonderful thing. Sure parenting him has a been taxing, but it has also been one of the most satisfying things as well. I cannot stop to think how blessed I am to be working from home and being available for him every single day.</p>
<p>I thought I will define how he is today in terms to traits, but then I also realise it is a futile exercise as it is constantly changing. For now I am really happy for the times he shows us how thoughtful and kind he can be. I can only hope he hones more of that, than anything else!</p>

			 <p>Meet my new kicks — a pair of <a href="https://www.camper.com/en_MY/men/shoes/pth/camper-peu_path-K100886-007">Camper Peu Path sneakers</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-7575.jpeg" alt="A pair of green sneakers with white soles from a brand named Camper, placed on red floor tiles"></p>
<p>From the way I refer to it, you might think I knew about this brand for a long time. But I hardly knew about them when I bought it.</p>
<p>So I was just in the market for some barefoot or minimalist shoes, to replace my current pair of walking/running shoes from Asics. And I want to try on shoes, before buying them. The ones I had in mind — Vivobarefoot and Xero shoes were out of question, since they were available only as an online purchase in Malaysia.</p>
<p>And barefoot or zero drop shoes are notoriously hard to come by here. After a while, last weekend I came across <a href="https://www.altrarunning.com/shop/men/mens-escalante-3-al0a7r6m?variationId=445">Altra Escalante</a> at The Running Lab in Exchange TRX. I really wanted to try it, but they did not have my size.</p>
<p>After checking out almost all the footwear shops, we aimlessly went into the one belonging to Camper. These Peu Path shoes immediately got my attention and on wearing them, they fit like a glove and it was joy at first try! I wanted another colour, but this one was on 50% off. It had everything I wanted — wide toe box, zero drop and barefoot ethos!</p>
<p>I later went about reading about the Camper brand and their shoes. Seems like a cool company.</p>
<p>It is nice how some shoes find you! So far I am enjoying these Peu Path shoes.</p>

			 <p>This device — <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/product">Daylight DC-1</a> is very tempting. It has the  charm of a Kindle with its fast refreshing e-ink technology. I am tempted mostly because it will be less strain on the eyes, and good for catching up on reading without much distractions. But then this is a first generation device. I will most probably wait out for the next version, when things settle down on the hardware and software front.</p>

<p>This is a very good beginner trail and traverses through two hills. If you are an absolute beginner, you can stop at the 1st hill and then head back. It would probably take you less than an hour. And if you want to make it hard then you can multiple loops of the 2nd hill.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are two options to go up the 2nd hill, and one of them does not have any tree cover.

<p>The view from the 2nd hill is great.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yesterday, we finished watching Premalu. I absolutely loved it. It is such a refreshing and light hearted movie, without being frivolous or over the top. It was very grounded and finds comedy even on the mundane things of life. We laughed all the way through — what a fun writing it has.</p>
<p>The story is a very generic story, of a boy and girl across different strata falling in love. But the entire treatment of setting up their ways of life, how they cross each others path and then become intertwined is all done so well and in a new way that you are sitting there and watching a slice of those lives. The movie begins and ends in a matter of fact manner, so there is no introduction or climax scene as such.</p>
<p>And all this wouldn&rsquo;t have worked out without the cast. Just spot on. The leads Naslen and Babitha have lived their roles, that you just don&rsquo;t see them as actors. And everyone of those supporting cast, support the leads so well, that you left wanting for more.</p>

			 <h2 id="ohboy-and-the-case-of-">#OhBoy and the case of 🖕</h2>
<p>Last week, it was just another day of vacation that was all fun, until we sat down for lunch. #OhBoy was arguing with my mom, I forget about what. But something she said irritated him a lot and he showed her the middle finger. 😮</p>
<p>This was not his first time. He did the same a few days ago, and I let it slide, thinking I misconstrued his gesture. This time, there was no doubt. There was a flash of anger in my face, but I was also sure that he was just showing off his anger, without knowing the actual meaning of the gesture.</p>
<p>I asked him what it was and where he learnt it from. Thus started our tussle. The entire lunch was a crying session, with him not wanting to talk about it or telling me where he picked it from. He switched excuses between — he does not remember, he does not want to tell, it meant a big heart, he read it in a dinosaur book, he dreamt about it etc. I kept at it, without shouting at him. I warned him that if I don’t get to know, then I will have to tell the school about it.</p>
<p>He clearly felt cornered. He understood it was a mistake, but did not want to reveal where he picked up this gesture from. At some level, I am amazed by his grit to not tell us the source. I wish he puts this grit to good use in his life.</p>
<p>He took his afternoon nap, under heavy threats and discussion. I spoke to my wife and also ended up reaching out to, what I call,  my parenting council <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I am writing down here the highlights of the points they told me, so it is helpful for those in similar situation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t dig into the source too much, as these days there are a lot of stimuli, and it will be pointless to get the the origin of this gesture. And also you may never find out.</li>
<li>Tell that the behaviour is unacceptable and in the family we are not hurtful or unkind to anyone.</li>
<li>Make them promise this will not be repeated.</li>
<li>If it happens next time, don’t react immediately, but bring it up later when settling down and tell that the behaviour was bad and not acceptable</li>
<li>Talk about the anger and how they feeling and help them express it in a better way. Anger stems from a feeling of loneliness, not physically but emotionally no one is understanding them.</li>
<li>Learn to stop ending arguments in one sitting and learn to stop and start conversations about it at a later point in time. Make him understand that while you are stopping the probe about it for now, it is still pending and you are awaiting for an answer. This will learn to take him, process and have the confidence to get back at a later point in time.</li>
<li>This is just the beginning, brace yourself to do this routine again and again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Armed with all these pointers, I woke up him from his nap and told him that I am letting go of the request for source, but I want him to promise that he will not do it ever again. And among us, no matter how difficult it is we will tell the truth and answer questions honestly. I also told him that I am not angry with him, but just trying to explain him what is right and wrong.</p>
<p>He seemed to be very relieved. He was all going overboard with his niceties in the evening! 😂</p>

			 <h2 id="finally-tasted-bak-kut-teh">Finally tasted Bak kut teh</h2>
<p>When we got to know that we will be moving to Kuala Lumpur, I went on a spree of watching  YouTube videos about places to eat and dishes to explore. That is when I first heard about Bak kut teh in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5CbeMsqNjo&amp;t=45s">Mickey Chen&rsquo;s video</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bak kut teh is a pork dish cooked in broth. It is very popular in Malaysia and Singapore. I has its origins among the Hokkien and Teochew community. The name translates as &ldquo;meat bone tea&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when I landed here and told people that I wanted to try it out, almost everyone warned me about the &ldquo;herbal taste&rdquo; of it. I really wanted to try it, but with someone who knew a good place to go, how to order. I never found that guide.</p>
<p>Last week, our wonderful Chinese neighbour came by with some fruits for our son and when asked to partake a snack, she said she was heavy with the Bak kut teh breakfast. So natually I enquired about the place and told her, I would like to join her next time.</p>
<p>That conversation led to me finally I tasted my first Bak kut teh today and loved it. We went to a place in Seri Bintang. It was a collection of stalls referred to as <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/HFzKQoyqHsyDBBri9">Kopitiam 818 Restaurant</a>. I was told this is Klang style Bak kut teh. Just a luscious and flavourful broth that I loved having multiple cups of. The meat was tender from hours of simmering and all the collagen 🤩</p>
<p><img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-6853.jpeg" alt="A claypot full of a pork broth dish called Bak kut teh, along with a bowl of plain rice">
<img src="https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-6854.jpeg" alt="Pork knuckle in Bak kut teh broth along with a bowl of rice">
It is a very hearty breakfast meal, so maybe next time I will combine with hike at the nearby Seri Bintang trail!</p>

<p>The trail after that was full of ups and downs, but what made it really hard were the roots. One had to be very watching where to place the feet and vary of tripping over the broken roots. I was the slow one in the group, inspite of being the youngest.

<p>This was the first time I was watching Ali Wong and Steven Yeun perform. And both were so good in their roles!</p>

It checks a lot of boxes to make pertinent points on racial prejudice, pressures in criminal justice system to “deliver” something, collateral damages etc. The tension between the two opposing detectives, is so palpable and enjoyable. Each episode ends in a nice cliffhanger.</p>
<p>Cush Jumbo and Peter Capaldi nail their parts and live their characters. Thoroughly enjoyed every episode. Highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a friend was stopping over in KL and was available for lunch. Since he was open to tasting some local fare, took him out to Anak Baba in Brickfields.</p>
<p>It is a quaint little place, with simple seating arrangement of table and stools and a lot of natural sunlight through the translucent roof. I had been there earlier once and loved their food.</p>
<p>This time around I tried their Nasi Lemak with fried chicken. Everything was spot on, but that fried chicken marinated in turmeric was just so rightly done—a light layer of fried coating on the outside and juicy on the inside!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The friend has Nyonya Laksa, which I had tried previously here. He loved it too.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We also had their Popiah (Peranakan Spring Roll), Pai Tee (picture below) and Cendol to round it all off.

<p>Overall the food and the interesting conversation, made it a memorable afternoon! Hope to bring the family here soon!</p>

<p>A cancelled meeting of <em>The Missus</em> resulted in we getting to do a quick lunch date on a weekday. We met at El Cero<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/VsrPwaqAMgeWv7VW9">📍</a> first and had a bunch of of tapas. While Tapas were good, the mains did not interest us, so we went out looking for another place.</p>
<p>This part of Chow Kit is peppered with restaurants and we landed at Gavel<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/49qZPHw7Mpxt752g6">📍</a> just that was a couple of doors away from El Cero. Gavel is a quaint little place. We wanted something quick and hence picked Fish &amp; Chips, which was the dish of the day. It did not disappoint. I really want to come there on Sunday for their Sunday Roast!</p>

<p>It was lovely hike. We finished the entire hike of 5.25km in about 2.5h. The trail is well maintained and the suspension bridges, add a bit of fun to the hike.</p>
<p>One thing, I really love about Kuala Lumpur is the access to hiking spots within the city!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On recommendation from a friend we watched the Malayalam movie Neru (Truth) a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>In typical Jeetu Joseph fashion, everything about the crime is laid out to you the audience. The drama is then about the ability of the prosecutor to prove beyond reasonable doubt in court. The Jeetu does it by stacking his scenes in a cat and mouse style of sequences.</p>
<p>The courtroom scenes were well written. Anaswara Rajan, the actor who performed the role of the victim was brilliantly casted!</p>
<p>It was a decent watch. And we were watching a court room drama after ages, so it was a welcome change.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Last week, I finished the 3rd season of Slow Horses. IMO, it is one of the best spy series on TV. It is not stuffed with action, but rather more like tense spy drama. It has a lot going for it — good writing, cracker dialogues, great characters and actors, good ol’ British humour and crafty twists.</p>
<p>My earlier benchmark for good spy drama on TV was <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/4046-spooks">Spooks (2002-2011)</a>. I know it is a couple of decades old and I am dating myself here, but it’s characters — Sir Harry Pearce and Ruth Evershed, were immortalised by their actors. One can draw a parallel for that relationship in Slow Horses between Jackson Lamb and Ruth Evershed. Each character in Slow Horse is an odd ball and their quirks add so much to the drama!</p>
<p>Cannot wait for Season 4 to be streamed!</p>

<p>Yesterday I went hiking up Gunung Datuk with a friend and his hiking group. This was my first long hike in KL and in a while too.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We started climbing about 7.15am and summited around 1h 45m later. The initial part, with the rocky trail and the jutting out roots was the hardest part.</p>
<p>The strong winds at the summit gave us a welcome break from all the exhaustion. After a quick round of snacks, we went up to the viewing point and clicked a few pictures.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We came back down in 1h 15m. While climbing down was less exhausting, it was strenuous on the knees. The hiking poles were put to good use to transfer some of the weight on to them!</p>
<p>Overall it was great hike. Looking forward to do many more in the coming months!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Watched this movie a couple of weeks ago. Loved it. Everything was almost perfect. The story arc, the characters, the actors — everything worked out for me. Also having seen the preparation for UPSC up close, and the toll it takes on students, the struggles they go through, the heart wrenching stories of those who put in their all, this movie really brought it all out very well and it brought back a lot of memories of those times.</p>
<p>The casting was just spot on. Vikrant Massey just lives the part and convinces you. I had only seen him earlier in <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/408624-a-death-in-the-gunj">A Death in the Gunj</a>. Looking forward to his other projects.</p>

			 <p>Good tidings! The Supreme Court of India has struck down the use of Electoral Bonds effectively immediately and make public the information of all the contributions made since 2019. 🙌🙌🙌</p>
<p>Electoral Bonds were an opaque system that enabled anonymous donations to political parties. While the claimed intention was to make political funding legitimate through mainstream banking channels, it was far from transparent as the donors were kept anonymous.</p>
<p>I hope the next amendment makes all parts of donations to political parties public information! 🤞</p>

			 <p>I was a software engineer till 2004, when I was actively writing code. Then MBA happened and the most code I ever wrote was in Microsoft Excel. And for the last decade and half in product management, the most I would do is read documentation to understand how something worked or sit with my development team to logically debug an issue (sometimes much to their annoyance!).</p>
<p>But over the last few months I have gotten back to coding, thanks to ChatGPT. It has been such a good companion for me to code with. No more reading through documentation or looking for boiler plate code in StackOverflow or GitHub to kickstart the development. All I need to do now is to keep explaining in plain English what I want, copy the code, tweak parts of it to my liking, run it, throw back the error at ChatGPT and then let it provide alternatives. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>The next decade in software engineering and development is going to be pretty wild!</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, we were invited to the inauguration of the newest restaurant in TTDI — Copper Grillhouse. It is the international avatar of the famous Copper Chimney chain of restaurants in India. They specialise in North Indian and North West Frontier cuisine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Overall we enjoyed the 5 course meal and the celebration. Here are notes on some of the dishes we really enjoyed.</p>
<p>For starters we had Kadak Roomali Roti and Chandni Chowk Chaat. I&rsquo;ve always relished the soft, chewy and cloth like thin Roomali Rotis, but this was the first time we had them crisp, in the shape of a wok. Also it was topped with a generous amount of Butter and spice powders, making it a tempting eat.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From the Tandoor Grills we limited ourselves to just had Paneer Tikka and Chicken Tikka, as we didn&rsquo;t want to fill ourselves before the main course. The Chicken Tikka was really tender and the dry mango powder (aamchur) in its marinade gave it a nice tang!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Between the courses, there was a nice performance by traditional Malay dance artists!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For the mains, we had the Lasooni Corn Palak. Lamb Rogan Josh and Gosht Dum Biryani. The gravies came with a bread basket. While the palak (spinach) was tasty with the kick of fried garlic, it had something grainy in it like sand, so we just let it be. The Lamb Rogan Josh was just perfect in every way. The gravy was deep red, silky smooth, tangy and spicy. And the meat was soft to the touch. We lapped it up.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By the time we came to the biryani, we were stuffed. We decided to taste just a spoon of it, but ended up having way more! 🙈 <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
It was one of the highlights of the evening for us.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We finished it all with one of the excellent Jabeli&rsquo;s I have had in the recent times — crisp, not too sweet and mildly tangy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We were invited to the event, so we have no idea of the prices of these dishes. But we really enjoyed the food and would highly recommend it!</p>

<p>Finished this TV Series last week. We quite enjoyed the over the top acting, paired to a dark comedy and thriller setup. Every actor seems to be having a good time in their roles and it was fun to watch them all.</p>
<p>What did not work well for me was the constant switch in languages, that was totally out of sync with the milieu and background of those actors. But that is a minor irritant and this is worth a watch!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P21EWjpzsaY">Sucharita says in this video</a>, the core plot is inspired from a real life incident, which in turn was inspired by a movie scene. What a full circle the idea has gone through!</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>#OhBoy has been curious about movies off late and has been asking us questions about cinema halls, do those things happen in real to those on screen etc. We explained movies to him by drawing parallel to photos and videos on mobile phone.</p>
<p>We want him to experience the big screen, but have not been able to choose a movie appropriate for his age. So we decided to show one of my all time favourites — The Lion King. It also helped that he had a book version of the movie, handed down by his cousins. He knew the plot, so we were spared the usual flurry of questions 🙈</p>
<p>At the end of it, he really enjoyed the movie and I am glad that his first film was one of my favourites!</p>

<p>After a good hike at the the Bukit Kiara trails at TTDI, we went to the Der Backmeister @ TTDI for a well earned breakfast. The place was full of folks digging into their food and that was a good sign!</p>
<p>We ordered their <em>The Big Backmeister</em> which was a mix platter of Ham, Salami, Breads, Buns and choice of eggs. When ordering the kind lady at the counter was attentive enough to ask how many folks were in our group. It was a big platter enough for 2 adults and a child.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We also ordered an Avocado and Egg Sandwich on Ciabatta, which was a huge. We asked them to pack the left over and they kindly obliged.</p>
<p>Their Caraibe Dark Chocolate deserves a special mention. It was just yum!</p>

			 <p>Merry Christmas! 🎄</p>
<p>Usually Christmas is at home or with family, but this time it is mostly on the road. Initially I was bummed by this, particularly it went contrary to our careful planning of comfortable travel and being with family.</p>
<p>But now I’m seeing this as the spirit of the season, after all the little Christ was born on a travel and in a short stay in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>I tell myself, it is important to remember that one  is surrounded my ones they love. And that is all that matters.</p>

			 <h1 id="i-can-finally-say-i-swim">I can finally say I swim</h1>
<p>One of my achievements of recent times would be learning to do the breaststroke. Today was the day I did 6 laps across the 50m pool in a calm non-panicky manner. I am quite proud of that!</p>
<p>Swimming has been elusive for me till now. There were many failed attempts to learn it. I was never comfortable with water for me to begin with. Also I was always learning with the help of friends, who while being kind were not the best to teach me the skill. There was a swimming coach in our campus in Delhi, but I think he was more of a lifeguard than a coach.</p>
<p>However it was in Delhi that I learnt to do the freestyle  by sheer brute force. I would kick the wall to gather a good momentum and then I couldn’t have anything stop me mid-way, nor could I miss the rhythm. Else I would just fluster and sink! But it was something better than nothing, and I could get some form of swimming done.</p>
<p>Finally in Kuala Lumpur, thanks to getting a swimming coach for #OhBoy, I got a chance to learn. The coach had to be hired by the hour and since #OhBoy was too young to continuously swim for an hour, we could use the rest of his time to learn ourselves. I chose to learn the breaststroke as I wanted to have a clean start. And it worked out.</p>
<p>Next would be to unlearn my way of doing brute force freestyle and learning to do it the proper way!</p>

<p>It is perhaps the longest lasting legacy of the pandemic: the loss that trickles its way through every part of society. The great reported and unreported loss of life looms as the world attempts to move on.

<p>Watched Leo today in the cinemas.</p>
<p>Overall it is a decent watch. It has many things going for it — a good premise, technical brilliance and good action set pieces.</p>
<p>My biggest dissatisfaction with the movie was the writing. It lacks the drama required to justify the actions of its characters. It all feels flimsy, ridden with logical loose ends and very non-practical stuff.</p>
<p>Sample a couple of things that I just could not let it slide by—</p>
<ul>
<li>For being an animal rescuer, the titular character after been clawed in by a wild beast, doesn’t even bother to wash the wound. He is specifically shown to just see it in mirror, change his shirt and go about business as usual.</li>
<li>In the climax the hero has setup traps along the walkway to his house, which his family is unaware of. Yeah it adds to the thrill, but if you are a parent and that too of a young child, you would know that this is just not how a parent would function. That too on the bloody walkway, for a unaware family that is indoors without you at home!</li>
</ul>
<p>For a director who gave us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maanagaram">Maanagaram</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaithi_(2019_film)">Kaithi</a> (where the the ton of action was ably supported by the drama set pieces), this feels like a decline.</p>
<p>I just wish Lokesh takes some more time for some solid writing, instead of this frantic pace of movie making!</p>

<p>Last evening was a date with The Missus after a long time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have been wanting to try a Japanese Izakaya in the neighbourhood called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shakariki432_sakedining">Shakariki432&quot;</a> and so we landed up there. We totally loved the vibe, the food and drinks.</p>
<p>We started off with Sapporo Beer🍺, Suntory Kaku Highball, Edamame, Beef Stew and Gyozas. Everything was spot on, in particular that Beef Stew was just 😍.</p>

<p>For the mains, we just shared a bowl of Ramen🍜, along with Aburi Shime Saba (Torched marinated Mackerel). Since it The Missus’s first time trying out Ramen we chose the milder broth style of Assari (missed a picture of it as well 😞). The Saba (Mackarel) was just basic and brilliant!</p>

<p>Overall an happy evening filled with good conversation, food and drinks!</p>

			 <p>A very good primer on Sex, Gender and how to update our thinking about it.</p>
<p>While I was aware of this idea of gender, the fluidity of it and how one is free to choose it, the highlights of this talk for me were —</p>
<ul>
<li>Jews are the only ones usually talked about as targets of Nazi holocaust. We tend to miss out the others who were also targetted - the queer people, gays, lesbians, people with disabilities, people with illnesses etc.</li>
<li>Our vocabulary of being inclusive is constantly evolving with ages. We have now learnt to better address people of colour, women etc. The evolution to address the non-binary folks in a better way, acknowledges their existence, which is the very start of hearing out to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go listen to the talk.</p>

			 <p>The below article by <a href="https://stephango.com/">Steph Ango</a>, resonates with how I would also approach purchases. It is nice to see how Steph has put a process heuristic around it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I buy things I try to prioritize <em>cost per use</em>. Sometimes I consider other priorities such as <em>cost per smile</em>, <em>cost per thrill</em>, <em>cost per externality</em>, and <em>cost per lesson</em>.</p>

			 <p>I have been accessing the internet since 1998. It started with chatting on Internet Relay Chatrooms (IRC) on text-based Unix terminals. I have come a long way today, being online almost all the time through my mobile and laptop. Someday, I hope to document the journey to this point, but for today, I will focus on the key milestone of my online journey—my own space at <a href="https://jrr.digital/">jrr.digital</a>.</p>
<p>After renting spaces online for email, blogs, microblogs, and photoblogs, I have finally come to realize the value of owning one&rsquo;s own space in the online world where the content is mine, and I am in control of it. I am no longer subject to whimsical policy changes or the whims of site owners I rent space from.</p>
<p>I know I am a few decades late to this game of owning one’s own site. I consciously stayed away from it because of the costs and effort involved in running one&rsquo;s site. Also, I&rsquo;ve always felt that I have a lot more to learn and know, so what new could I actually add in terms of posts?</p>
<p>However, over the years, I have realized that learning is a continuous process, and it is better to learn in public. I used to be concerned about contradicting myself over the years. But I now realize that I am a work in progress and will continue to be one forever. In the process, we may never look at the same thing in the same way. It is no longer me contradicting myself, but it is just me growing into, or rather being who I am today.</p>
<p>As far as the costs are concerned, it is affordable for me now. I have been paying for my own email for the last couple of years, and at $50 a year, it gives me a lot of peace of mind and control over my email aliases. As for the website, I liked the idea of Wordpress and the simplicity of hosting your own place on the internet there. However, off late, I have been enamored by the principles of <a href="https://indieweb.org/">Indie Web</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>. I find <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.Blog</a> a perfect fit for what I want today. It has everything I need—hosting a site, options for both long form and short form, photo blogging, cross-posting, etc. And all of this at $50 a year.</p>
<p>So here I am, taking the plunge of buying my own domain <a href="https://jrr.digital/">jrr.digital</a>, hosting it on <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.Blog</a>, finding a new home for all my previous online posts (<a href="https://jrr.digital/categories/instagrams/">Instagrams</a> and <a href="https://jrr.digital/tweets/">Tweets</a>), and starting to share my thoughts here, beginning with this post.</p>
<p>I have a vague idea of how I want to organize this place—posts, interesting links, photos, books, etc. I hope to do this over time as I tend to this digital garden of mine. 🤞🏼</p>

			<h1><a href="https://jrr.digital/2021/05/21/st-anniversary-of.html">1st Anniversary of Sleep Training</a></h1>

			 <p>At around 7.30p each day, #OhBoy kisses and waves everyone good night. Me and him step into the bedroom and approx. 20mins later I am out. He sleeps through the night and wakes up at around 6am next morning.</p>
<p>This was not the case a year ago. Here is our journey.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-was">How it was</h2>
<p>A year ago, #OhBoy would wake up every 45m to an hour and would only fall asleep with a feed. He was using The Missus as a soothing toy to fall sleep. Both of them were not happy with this arrangement and resulted in cranky behavior throughout the day (dare I say for both!).</p>
<p>Things got so bad that we would dread evenings as the sleep time approached. This is the time The Missus read about sleep training (on Mint Lounge, I think). She searched about the author Kerry Bajaj and purchased her book—<a href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/9353576601/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_4Q22BGEQMGG0EWAV86BY">Sleep, Baby, Sleep</a>, on Kindle.</p>
<h2 id="discovering-sleep-training">Discovering sleep training</h2>
<p>The Missus read it first and was convinced on the way forward. I read the first chapter and agreed with her. The book talks of many things—setting a routine and avoid surprises, being boring at sleep time, low to no light in the room, white noise etc.</p>
<p>We were adopting some of those things already. Like an evening routine—bath, powder, read a book and sleep, using yellow lights instead of white lights etc.</p>
<h2 id="braving-the-start">Braving the start</h2>
<p>A year ago from today, 29th May 2020, we went cold turkey to begin sleep training. We stuck newspapers on windows to block ambient light. Setup a nice cozy bed for the evening and showed it to #OhBoy all day to make it familiar. Fed him well to sustain the night. I had an early dinner at 7.30p and went into the room with him. I locked ourselves up with just a bottle of water for him and a speaker playing rain sounds.</p>
<p>After almost 45mins of crying and fighting to get out of the room, he slept off. It was tough on us to bear those cries, but we all believed it was the right thing.</p>
<p>The first night he woke up 4-5 times. Each time I gave him water and he grudgingly had it and fought a little, but went back to sleep.</p>
<p>He was on a two nap routine, so we did the same next day for his morning and afternoon naps as well. Day naps were tougher than nights, given the daylight around. But we made it a point that this was the way he is going to sleep.</p>
<h2 id="the-transformation">The transformation</h2>
<p>What started with so much resistance from him, went on to become something he loved. He began seeing sleep as an enjoyable activity, instead of something that made him miss all the fun around.</p>
<p>During the course of the year, we invested in a separate bed/crib for him.</p>
<p>We went on a couple of vacations, but all through, kept up with the routine (much to the disappointing nods from many around!).</p>
<p>We also took turns on who would put him to sleep, so he would not build an attachment to just one of us to fall asleep.</p>
<p>We were able to see the change. He was a happier kid with less cranky outbursts. More importantly he embraced sleep as another essential activity.</p>
<p>We still have off-days once in a while, when he wants to lie in bed and throw silly tantrums. Then there are days when he goes on about choosing pillows/sheets, wanting to get cozy on the shoulder, asking to pat or sing a song etc. But more often than not, we both would get in, talk for a while and he would lie down, toss around and fall asleep.</p>
<p>We see our role now as those enabling him to catch the sleep train each night.</p>
<h2 id="our-guide-for-sleep-training">Our guide for sleep training</h2>
<p>We highly recommend the book <a href="https://www.amazon.in/dp/9353576601/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_4Q22BGEQMGG0EWAV86BY">Sleep, Baby, Sleep</a> by <a href="https://kerrybajaj.com/">Kerry Bajaj</a>. In fact, we have presented the book to new parents in our circles and talked about it at every chance with new parents.

<p><em>PS:
Yes, our parents did not follow this &ldquo;fad&rdquo; of sleep training. But this is the need of our times. Super bright lights, plethora of screens, increased ambient noises etc., have all changed since we were kids. IMO to accommodate all these changes, we need to sleep train kids. Else it is a disservice to them.</em></p>

<p>So we got him his first book which is about shapes and colours. And now mornings are spent showing and telling stories on them.</p>
<p>He is a happy one staring at them in loop. And his latest trick is that, if you lift a page, he turns it for you 😱</p>

<p>It is simple to make. Grate a tomato (we being us, grate a green chilli or two as well) and add salt to taste. Toast bread slices and you are done. .
Today we added a Cheese Omelette. Coz more cheese is always welcome! 😜</p>
<p>While at it, the #Ciabatta bread at @oldmadrasbakingcompany is our latest favourite. Hard on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, it is good both plain and toasted. Look at those air pockets in the bread! 🤩</p>

			 <p>We had consciously decided to use disposable diapers only when travelling outside with #OhBoy! At home we decided to use just cloth nappies.</p>
<p>All it took was 2 weeks to look for alternatives, since the daily rinse and wash cycle was getting too much 🙈and coupled with the rains the drying was taking way longer 🕰! And most importantly #OhBoy! would wake up frequently and be cranky.</p>
<p>We were looking for cloth based diapers and ended up with <a href="https://superbottoms.com">@superbottoms</a>. We are super happy with their product. It sits nicely between meeting the functional need and being eco friendly. They also had a friendly on-boarding and follow up process!!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/v.niths/">@v.niths</a> and I started our career together at TCS, in the same training batch at Trivandrum. It surprising to this day, how we stayed in touch, given that we were at each other’s throats at every possible opportunity during the training.</p>
<p>But then we did stay in touch and kept meeting all around the world - Mumbai, Bangalore, SFO and now Chennai. Hope to see you at some other corner of the world <a href="https://www.instagram.com/v.niths/">@v.niths</a>. And happy 40th to you! 🥳</p>

			 <p>Over the weekend we had our school get together. Some 32 of us made it to the reunion. Many of us were meeting after 20+ years. For a few hours the 40 year olds magically transformed to high school kids. How happy were we to be together again!</p>
<p>Flood gates of really old memories were opened up. What fun it was to be with this bunch, who had a common childhood and school life and many many shared memories.</p>
<p>This was for most part enabled by us living in a gated community (or colony we call it) of our parent’s employers, which also had our school inside it. And hindsight, we were indeed blessed to have had such a setup.</p>

			 <p>Most folks get retrospective hitting this number. I am just swamped doing the chores of #OhBoy
What I am feeling though is a sense of gratefulness. For all what life has offered up to now and where it has me today.</p>
<p>I am grateful for things at home. Couldn’t ask for anything more.</p>
<p>I am grateful for things I get to do at work. I am enjoying it and hope the folks around me are too :) I am grateful for the kind folks in family and friends circles, for keeping us in their thoughts and helping us at times of need.</p>
<p>At this stage of life, you know nothing lasts forever. You just savor the most out of the present and hope the good things last as long as they can and the tough periods are short and leave you with learnings!</p>
<p>Here is to life, the great 40 years and some more to come :)</p>

<p>I used to be crazy about toppings (pepperoni, meatballs, sausages). Over a period of time, I&rsquo;ve grown to appreciate the bread/crust of a pizza more than the toppings on it. Now all I crave is a pizza base cooked to perfection with a basic topping of tomato sauce and mozzarella.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefatboychennai/">@thefatboychennai</a> is one place that bakes such perfects pies. Their airy dough, beautifully charred in their wood fired oven, is such a delight to have. You should check them out if you are in Chennai!</p>
<p>The one in the picture is their Hot Boy pizza. If you love spicy food, this is your pie. .</p>

			 <p>These beautifully ripe and plump Rumani mangoes were plucked last week at a farm on ECR!</p>
<p>While last summer we had 13 varieties of mangoes, this year has been more satisfying with just 2 varieties - Imampasand and Rumani.</p>

			 <p>A couple of days ago, we had been to Abid’s at Spur Tank Road, #Chennai for tasting their #Ramzan iftar menu.</p>
<p>Loved both their Mutton #Haleem and #Nombukanji. Their Haleem was way better than Fisherman’s Fare and Pista House and very reasonably priced too. This was our first time tasting Nombukanji and really loved the lightly flavoured rice and meat porridge.</p>
<p>For the main course, we ordered Pathar ke Gosht and Laham Mandi. Pathar ke Gosht was soft for the most part. But the Mandi was the star of the meal. This highly flavourful Yemeni rice dish was very mild on spice. With the red sauce that was spicy and tangy, it was just perfect. The mutton though looks tough, was falling off the bone.</p>
<p>We ended the meal with our favourite dessert Khubani ka Meeta served along with heavy cream. Heavenly.</p>
<p>At home, I found myself enjoying the lingering flavours of the food in my hands. It was a wonderful meal.</p>

<p>This was how the epic lunch at the New Pattukottai Kamatchi Mess started.</p>
<p>While this might not look much, their approach of making every gravy/kozhambu on the menu available along with unlimited rice is easy to make anyone a glutton.</p>
<p>Loved everything that was served—Mutton Sukka, Prawn Masala, Viral Meen fry, Chicken Theregal, Crab Masala, Chicken gravies, Crab Curry, Mutton Kozhambu, Fish Curry etc. Among all of those, Brain Fry and Karuvadu Sambal were pretty epic.</p>
<p>Just one advice. Don&rsquo;t go there if you have to work post lunch.</p>

			 <p>With a decision to move away from shaving foams, gels and creams and go old school with #shaving soaps, I gave <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepinkwoolf/">@thepinkwoolf</a> a try. I am really impressed with the lather of their soap! What impressed me more was the hand written note that came along with it. What a nice thought!! That and a nice small free sample 😋</p>
<p>Thank you Subodh of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thepinkwoolf/">@thepinkwoolf</a> for the note. And here is the feedback you asked for.</p>

<p>After reading about Hotel Suprabha from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mytrystwithfood/">@mytrystwithfood</a>&rsquo;s blog, ended up there for lunch last Saturday and again today.</p>
<p>This is simple food done right and made accessible to all. For ₹80 you get a mound of rice, a dry vegetable, a wet vegetable, a chutney, plain dal and ghee, sambhar, morkozhambhu, rasam and buttermilk. Everything is top notch. And yeah you get extra rice if you finish the fist mound :)</p>
<p>A total fan of their food. While I can travel far for good food, this being at walking distance from home is a bonus!!</p>

			 <p>Wrapping down this year’s dining out was the lunch at Dahlia. It was extra special because Dahlia itself was closing down on the 31st as the owner is taking retirement.</p>
<p>The Sushi Moriawase, Beef Steak and the Beef Onion Udon were just spot on. I really loved their Tori Butter Yaki, chicken cooked in butter. What an amazingly simple and flavorful dish!</p>
<p>I was glad I could make it before they down their shutters. So long Dahlia!</p>

			 <p>If you are fan of pork or on the cusp of trying out pork for the first time, then <a href="https://www.instagram.com/justoinkme/">@justoinkme</a> is the place to be! Their Porky Pav (Coorgi Pandi Curry as a Slider) and Chilli Pork are so damn good. The Chicken Hot Dog, the only chicken dish in the menu, is also well done. Pork Ribs and Sausages were over for the day, so we settled down for a few rashers of bacon.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the hygiene of eating pork, then this place will allay those fears. They know their pork and carefully source and cook them too. Give them a go!</p>

			 <p>This is from last Saturday. True to its name Fromage was a very cheesy affair!</p>
<p>The Broccoli &amp; Cheddar soup in a bread bowl set the tone. They were not stingy on the cheese 🧀! The filo pastry pockets with onion &amp; goat cheese and pull part bread were cheesy but just OK.</p>
<p>The Parmesan Wheel pasta was both a visual treat and tasty as well. The pasta was perfectly al-dente and oozing with Parmesan. Loved it.</p>
<p>The Cheesecake Flan would have been perfect if the sugar at the bottom had been burnt a bit more!! .
We should be here again soon to try their burgers.</p>

			 <p>When shopping for fish at the Saidapet Fish Market, we made a pit stop at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/62mEsLHmotscN7919">Mari Hotel</a> for their famous Vada Curry.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the Vada Curry was excellent. But their Dosai there was even better than that. A well fermented batter, spread thin enough to crisp and yet thick enough to have a bite!! A must try if you are around the area.</p>

			 <p>While the plan was to go to a different restaurant for her birthday, The Missus switched her mind on seeing the name — Nasi Kandar Pelita. And what a serendipitous find it turned out to be.</p>
<p>The place serves #Malaysian, Chinese and North Indian, but stick to just Malaysian items on the menu. Lots of folks dining there, knew their way through the menu. We just went by famous dishes and familiar names.</p>
<p>Loved their Paya Soup and Mutton Sambal Nasi Kandar (Malaysia version of set meals). The Dal Curry served with Roti Canai (Malaysian version of #Parotta) was my favorite of all the dishes.</p>
<p>Going by this experience, we may pay them a visit sometime soon :)</p>

			 <p>Last weekend in Pondicherry was stuffed with good food. This was the breakfast at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/breadandchocolate_india/">@breadandchocolate_india</a>. Highly recommend the place. Everything we had there were 👌!!</p>
<p>The Croissant 🥐 reminded us of the ones we had in Paris. Just so damn good. The Summer time Tartine (swipe right) was pure awesomeness of good #sourdough bread, toasted to perfection, spread with locally made Ricotta cheese and topped with 2 poached eggs!!</p>

			 <p>While we went to Abid&rsquo;s to taste the Ramzan special of Haleem and NombuKanji , we missed it by 30 mins. The stock for the day got over. We ended up having Hyderabadi Dum Biryani, which was just OK.</p>
<p>The highlight of the evening was the Khubani Ka Meeta (Apricot compote) with fresh cream. Hands down the best I&rsquo;ve had ever! It took care of all the disappointments of missing the Ramzan fare and some more :)</p>

<p>Living next door, I was really enthusiastic about this place and looking forward to this meal. But the overall experience was just meh .

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The cheese fondue was more cream sauce used for pasta and pickled vegetables for this place means pickled Jalapeños and Olives! 🤦‍♂️
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The pizza had nothing to complain about, except that the Soul Garden special was not special by any means!
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The aglio e olio (no picture) is our usual measuring stick of a pasta cook. This simple dish of just garlic and olive oil is real tough to mask the shortcomings of ingredients or skills! The pasta we ordered was not garlicky at all and lacked the basic emulsification! What a mess!!</p>
<p>The 3 cheese sandwich, for sure did not have 3 cheese in it. And the bread was just off the shelf supermarket variety. 🤷‍♂️

<p>Sad that a restaurant right next door has turned out be so bad!</p>

			 <p>When I heard “Murukku Sandwich”, I assumed he would place crushed murukku inside a regular sandwich. But this roadside vendor in #Sowcarpet was innovative in using these tiny murukku as bread for the sandwich. And between two murukku there were tiny slithers of cucumber, tomato, onion and chutney. That’s pretty good #FusionFood I would say! It was super fun to eat too!!</p>

<p>The highlight of the evening was the decadent Podi Idli and Podi Uthappam at Seena Bhai Tiffin Centre. The place serves just those two dishes and the crowds can’t have enough of it. Don’t go there if you watch your oil intake. They drench the Idli and Uthappam in Ghee! Of course, we totally loved it😍</p>

			 <p>We had long awaited for an occasion to dine in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/masalalibrary/">@masalalibrary</a> and finally it came in the form of the 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://www.instagram.com/indianaccent/">@indianaccent</a> was style with substance, Masala Library was more style than substance. Of the dishes we ordered, we felt focus was more on fusing the different styles and cuisines, than the end result. But not all was lost, here are some of the dishes we enjoyed – Mango in jellied form with Coconut milk presented as a cracked egg, Galouti abab on an extremely soft Khamiri roti, Cod fish Kichidi which was more of a risotto and dehydrated and candied orange. The one we really loved was Jalebi Caviar served in a conch with rabri and saffron air!</p>

			 <p>The Missus’ birthday lunch was at our favourite pizza joint in Delhi <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/nzUyi16cgbLKVCSN8">28 Capri Italy</a>.</p>
<p>We had the lovely Spinach Dip, Meatball Pizza and Sicilia Pizza.</p>
<p>The hot and creamy Spinach Dip with crunchy toast on a rainy afternoon was just the perfect start. Had it been at home, the bowl would have been squeaky clean 😎.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The Caesar Salad on the other hand was an absolute wimp, having neither crunch nor taste. It could have been avoided.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Their pizzas as usual stood out and provided a sense of satisfaction that all is still well in this old joint. Especially the Sicilia, it was a burst of flavours. Totally loved it.

<p>They did not skimp on the meat in the Momos. Look at their size!

<p>The Naga Thali was a nice introduction to the variety on offer. As I mentioned before, super light and healthy. The Raja Mirch extra spicy chicken was not that spicy for us. The chutneys in our house are at times spicier than this 😜.

<p>Along with the lunch we had some Korean Rice Beer. Tried it for the first time and super liked it. A very summery drink with very little fizz and full of flavor!

			 <p>Got a chance yesterday to participate in a lunch event at the Residence of the Ambassador of Netherlands. This devilishly simple looking 3 course meal was just perfect. My favourite was the first and the last course. The creaminess of the Avacado Mousse along with the tartness of grated tomato was just divine. The last dish was Panna Cotta. It was my first time and ranks easily among the best desserts I&rsquo;ve had!</p>

The highlight of the meal was Salmon fillet en croute (puff pastry).

<p>The salmon was fatty (read tasty) and the puff pastry crust was perfectly crisp. The cranberry sauce and hollandaise sauce complemented the Salmon flavour well!</p>
