Everyone did or does things as a product of their situation and it is beautifully brought out. No one is blamed, everyone is compassionate and everyone is accepting. </p><p>While the quick acceptance all around is almost unbelievable, that the topic of homosexuality is the core of this mainstream cinema and that the macho-man of Malayalam cinema, Mammooty does this role, makes you look past all that and welcome this movie with a smile.

				"content_html": "<p>At around 7.30p each day, #OhBoy kisses and waves everyone good night. Me and him step into the bedroom and approx. 20mins later I am out. He sleeps through the night and wakes up at around 6am next morning.</p>\n<p>This was not the case a year ago. Here is our journey.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-it-was\">How it was</h2>\n<p>A year ago, #OhBoy would wake up every 45m to an hour and would only fall asleep with a feed. He was using The Missus as a soothing toy to fall sleep. Both of them were not happy with this arrangement and resulted in cranky behavior throughout the day (dare I say for both!).</p>\n<p>Things got so bad that we would dread evenings as the sleep time approached. This is the time The Missus read about sleep training (on Mint Lounge, I think). She searched about the author Kerry Bajaj and purchased her book‚Äî<a href=\"https://www.amazon.in/dp/9353576601/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_4Q22BGEQMGG0EWAV86BY\">Sleep, Baby, Sleep</a>, on Kindle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"discovering-sleep-training\">Discovering sleep training</h2>\n<p>The Missus read it first and was convinced on the way forward. I read the first chapter and agreed with her. The book talks of many things‚Äîsetting a routine and avoid surprises, being boring at sleep time, low to no light in the room, white noise etc.</p>\n<p>We were adopting some of those things already. Like an evening routine‚Äîbath, powder, read a book and sleep, using yellow lights instead of white lights etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"braving-the-start\">Braving the start</h2>\n<p>A year ago from today, 29th May 2020, we went cold turkey to begin sleep training. We stuck newspapers on windows to block ambient light. Setup a nice cozy bed for the evening and showed it to #OhBoy all day to make it familiar. Fed him well to sustain the night. I had an early dinner at 7.30p and went into the room with him. I locked ourselves up with just a bottle of water for him and a speaker playing rain sounds.</p>\n<p>After almost 45mins of crying and fighting to get out of the room, he slept off. It was tough on us to bear those cries, but we all believed it was the right thing.</p>\n<p>The first night he woke up 4-5 times.

				"content_text": "At around 7.30p each day, #OhBoy kisses and waves everyone good night. Me and him step into the bedroom and approx. 20mins later I am out. He sleeps through the night and wakes up at around 6am next morning.\n\nThis was not the case a year ago. Here is our journey.\n\n## How it was\nA year ago, #OhBoy would wake up every 45m to an hour and would only fall asleep with a feed. He was using The Missus as a soothing toy to fall sleep. Both of them were not happy with this arrangement and resulted in cranky behavior throughout the day (dare I say for both!).\n\nThings got so bad that we would dread evenings as the sleep time approached. This is the time The Missus read about sleep training (on Mint Lounge, I think). She searched about the author Kerry Bajaj and purchased her book‚Äî[Sleep, Baby, Sleep](https://www.amazon.in/dp/9353576601/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_4Q22BGEQMGG0EWAV86BY), on Kindle.\n\n## Discovering sleep training\nThe Missus read it first and was convinced on the way forward. I read the first chapter and agreed with her. The book talks of many things‚Äîsetting a routine and avoid surprises, being boring at sleep time, low to no light in the room, white noise etc.\n\nWe were adopting some of those things already. Like an evening routine‚Äîbath, powder, read a book and sleep, using yellow lights instead of white lights etc.\n\n## Braving the start\nA year ago from today, 29th May 2020, we went cold turkey to begin sleep training. We stuck newspapers on windows to block ambient light. Setup a nice cozy bed for the evening and showed it to #OhBoy all day to make it familiar. Fed him well to sustain the night. I had an early dinner at 7.30p and went into the room with him. I locked ourselves up with just a bottle of water for him and a speaker playing rain sounds.\n\nAfter almost 45mins of crying and fighting to get out of the room, he slept off. It was tough on us to bear those cries, but we all believed it was the right thing.\n\nThe first night he woke up 4-5 times. Each time I gave him water and he grudgingly had it and fought a little, but went back to sleep.\n\nHe was on a two nap routine, so we did the same next day for his morning and afternoon naps as well. Day naps were tougher than nights, given the daylight around. But we made it a point that this was the way he is going to sleep.\n\n## The transformation\nWhat started with so much resistance from him, went on to become something he loved. He began seeing sleep as an enjoyable activity, instead of something that made him miss all the fun around.\n\nDuring the course of the year, we invested in a separate bed/crib for him.\n\nWe went on a couple of vacations, but all through, kept up with the routine (much to the disappointing nods from many around!). \n\nWe also took turns on who would put him to sleep, so he would not build an attachment to just one of us to fall asleep.\n\nWe were able to see the change. He was a happier kid with less cranky outbursts. More importantly he embraced sleep as another essential activity.\n\nWe still have off-days once in a while, when he wants to lie in bed and throw silly tantrums. Then there are days when he goes on about choosing pillows/sheets, wanting to get cozy on the shoulder, asking to pat or sing a song etc. But more often than not, we both would get in, talk for a while and he would lie down, toss around and fall asleep. \n\nWe see our role now as those enabling him to catch the sleep train each night.\n\n## Our guide for sleep training\nWe highly recommend the book [Sleep, Baby, Sleep](https://www.amazon.in/dp/9353576601/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_4Q22BGEQMGG0EWAV86BY) by [Kerry Bajaj](https://kerrybajaj.com/).

				"content_text": "This is from last Saturday. True to its name Fromage was a very cheesy affair!\n\nThe Broccoli & Cheddar soup in a bread bowl set the tone. They were not stingy on the cheese üßÄ! The filo pastry pockets with onion & goat cheese and pull part bread were cheesy but just OK.\n\nThe Parmesan Wheel pasta was both a visual treat and tasty as well. The pasta was perfectly al-dente and oozing with Parmesan. Loved it.\n\nThe Cheesecake Flan would have been perfect if the sugar at the bottom had been burnt a bit more!! .\nWe should be here again soon to try their burgers.\n\n#Food #Cheese #Pasta #Chennai #ChennaiDiaries #DiningOut\n\n<img src=\"https://jrr.micro.blog/uploads/2023/dc78749eae.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"https://jrr.micro.blog/uploads/2023/451e4e477a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"https://jrr.micro.blog/uploads/2023/ef81934512.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"https://jrr.micro.blog/uploads/2023/93b67d3bda.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"https://jrr.micro.blog/uploads/2023/889e81844b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"https://jrr.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f650191352.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"https://jrr.micro.blog/uploads/2023/130cf97308.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n",
