Constipation is when either child does not pass stools or the stool is very hard and large\n2. The symptoms for this are \n\t- less than 3 bowel movements a week\n\t-  dry and hard stools that are painful to pass\n\t-  bloated with abdominal pains\n\t-  stomach pains that improve after they poop\n\t- traces of liquid or pasty stool in the underwear\n\t- blood on stool\n\t- poops like pellets\n4. The cause for this could be any of the following\n\t- Diet — lack of fiber, not having enough fluids, more junk food, lots of daily products (Cheese, milk)\n\t- Lack of physical activity\n\t- Withholding (due to involvement in play or hesitation to use the toilets)\n\t- Emotional — Stress in family/life\n\t- Busy children — Who ignore body signals for want to play, too packed schedule\n\t- Underlying physical condition\n5. Changes to reduce such occurrences\n\t- Change in diet to include more fiber (Fruits, vegetables)\n\t- Intake lot of fluids\n\t- Get more exercise or physical activity\n\t- Good toilet habits — twice a day sitting on the toilet for 10 minutes, approximately 30 mins after a meal\n\nYou can read more about this at the following links \n1.

If you are an absolute beginner, you can stop at the 1st hill and then head back. It would probably take you less than an hour. And if you want to make it hard then you can multiple loops of the 2nd hill.<br /> <br />There are two options to go up the 2nd hill, and one of them does not have any tree cover. So if you are planning to do it late in the morning, I would suggest some full sleeves and sunscreen.\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--jpeg\">\n      <img srcset=\"https://cdn.scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdkphIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--1dab75cce4830a097bb99f6a27d7ce181cea8576/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ0FCQnBBZ0FNT2dwellYWmxjbnNIT2dwemRISnBjRlE2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwWkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--a744d8f75451afbcf118ec59ae617394a12029aa/IMG_7253.jpeg 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"A open trail between two hills.\" src=\"https://cdn.scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdkphIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--1dab75cce4830a097bb99f6a27d7ce181cea8576/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ0FBaHBBZ0FHT2dwellYWmxjbnNIT2dwemRISnBjRlE2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwWkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--fa3dbe24e376882dfd8c9dddfec0441143a8bd41/IMG_7253.jpeg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      View of the trail to 2nd hill\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe view from the 2nd hill is great.\n\n\n<div class=\"attachment-gallery attachment-gallery--2\">\n  \n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--jpeg\">\n      <img srcset=\"https://cdn.scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdk5hIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--bb179f8b3471bb327fc1c4055d12d493b6fad928/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ0FCQnBBZ0FNT2dwellYWmxjbnNIT2dwemRISnBjRlE2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwWkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--a744d8f75451afbcf118ec59ae617394a12029aa/IMG_7242.jpeg 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"City skyline view from teh 2nd hill of Sri Bintang\" src=\"https://cdn.scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdk5hIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--bb179f8b3471bb327fc1c4055d12d493b6fad928/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ0FBaHBBZ0FHT2dwellYWmxjbnNIT2dwemRISnBjRlE2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwWkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--fa3dbe24e376882dfd8c9dddfec0441143a8bd41/IMG_7242.jpeg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      View after you reach atop 2nd Hill\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--jpeg\">\n      <img srcset=\"https://cdn.scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdlJhIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--99c293493a1089e02d6e468bd35b46c6a5a8d93d/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ0FCQnBBZ0FNT2dwellYWmxjbnNIT2dwemRISnBjRlE2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwWkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--a744d8f75451afbcf118ec59ae617394a12029aa/IMG_7243.jpeg 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Panoramic view of KL city from Sri Bintang Hill\" src=\"https://cdn.scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBdlJhIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--99c293493a1089e02d6e468bd35b46c6a5a8d93d/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ0FBaHBBZ0FHT2dwellYWmxjbnNIT2dwemRISnBjRlE2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwWkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--fa3dbe24e376882dfd8c9dddfec0441143a8bd41/IMG_7243.jpeg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      Panoramic view from the 2nd Hill\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the 2nd hike here over the weekend, there was a hiking group who were there with some of their pet dogs.

For a few hours the 40 year olds magically transformed to high school kids. How happy were we to be together again!\n\nFlood gates of really old memories were opened up. What fun it was to be with this bunch, who had a common childhood and school life and many many shared memories.\n\nThis was for most part enabled by us living in a gated community (or colony we call it) of our parent’s employers, which also had our school inside it. And hindsight, we were indeed blessed to have had such a setup.\n\n #Reunion #SchoolReunion #BatchOf96 #SpicSchool #ChennaiDiaries\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/b69791075c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/d1125ab74c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/ea539d1a90.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/ff0d2cf03a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/fefef99199.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" alt=\"\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
