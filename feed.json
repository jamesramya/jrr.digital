However, off late, I have been enamored by the principles of [Indie Web](https://indieweb.org/) and [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse). I find [Micro.Blog](https://micro.blog/) a perfect fit for what I want today. It has everything I need—hosting a site, options for both long form and short form, photo blogging, cross-posting, etc. And all of this at $50 a year.\n\nSo here I am, taking the plunge of buying my own domain [jrr.digital](https://jrr.digital/), hosting it on [Micro.Blog](https://micro.blog/), finding a new home for all my previous online posts ([Instagrams](https://jrr.digital/categories/instagrams/) and [Tweets](https://jrr.digital/tweets/)), and starting to share my thoughts here, beginning with this post.\n\nI have a vague idea of how I want to organize this place—posts, interesting links, photos, books, etc. I hope to do this over time as I tend to this digital garden of mine. 🤞🏼\n",

For a few hours the 40 year olds magically transformed to high school kids. How happy were we to be together again!\n\nFlood gates of really old memories were opened up. What fun it was to be with this bunch, who had a common childhood and school life and many many shared memories.\n\nThis was for most part enabled by us living in a gated community (or colony we call it) of our parent’s employers, which also had our school inside it. And hindsight, we were indeed blessed to have had such a setup.\n\n #Reunion #SchoolReunion #BatchOf96 #SpicSchool #ChennaiDiaries\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/b69791075c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/d1125ab74c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/ea539d1a90.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/ff0d2cf03a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" alt=\"\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/fefef99199.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"453\" alt=\"\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
