You\nknow that saying about it taking a village? Well, this is my village.</p>\n\n<h2>Folks at Home</h2>\n\n<p>Thanks to <strong>The Missus</strong> for being such a sport from the\nmoment she heard about this crazy possibility. She joined me on all\nthose practice hikes even knowing she wouldn&#39;t be able to do the actual\ntrek herself. That&#39;s love, right there. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>\n\n<p>Thank you to my mother and #OhBoy, who have graciously kept their\napprehensions to themselves and supported this adventure. They&#39;ve been\nwonderful about us being away for hours every Saturday, letting me chase\nthis dream.</p>\n\n<h2>The Team at <a href=\"https://thequad.in/\">The Quad</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>From the moment I told <a\nhref=\"https://www.instagram.com/soundarya83/\">Coach Chow</a> at <a\nhref=\"https://thequad.in/\">The Quad</a> about this trek, she was\ngenuinely excited for me. She made sure I connected with people who had\nalready conquered this mountain and assigned Coach Yogesh to create my\ntraining plan.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/coach.yogeshb/\">Coach Yogesh</a>\ntruly understood the limitations of my situation and location, crafting\na plan that worked perfectly for where I was. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>Later, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/roshiiini_31/\">Coach\nRoshini</a> became my accountability partner, checking in regularly and\nkeeping me motivated when the going got tough.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to all of them, I feel so much more prepared and confident about\ntaking on this challenge!</p>\n\n<h2>The Generous Souls Who Shared Their Time</h2>\n\n<p>Through The Quad and other networks, I connected with folks who had\nsuccessfully summited Kilimanjaro. Each one of them graciously spent\ntime with me on calls, sharing what to expect and how to prepare. Every\nconversation added a different dimension to my understanding and\ntraining.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you Aswani Kumar Yerguntala, <a\nhref=\"https://www.instagram.com/sarasnat/\">Saraswathy Natarajan</a>, <a\nhref=\"https://x.com/filby\">Filbert Pradeep</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://www.instagram.com/amany_khalil66/\">Amany Khalil</a>! I\npromise to pay forward the kindness you&#39;ve shared with me.</p>\n\n<p>And a special thanks to <a\nhref=\"https://www.instagram.com/merabetzohra/\">Zohra Merabet</a>¬† for\nconnecting me with Amany!</p>\n\n<h2>The Gear Angels</h2>\n\n<p>Being in Egypt meant I didn&#39;t have access to much of the trekking gear I\nneeded. So I asked friends who were traveling to Cairo to help me out.\nThese amazing people made sure I had everything I needed:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Anusha Srinivasan</strong> ‚Äî who ordered exactly what I wanted\nfrom Amazon.ca<br /><strong>Diya</strong> ‚Äî who carried those items all\nthe way from Canada to Cairo<br /><strong>Sufian</strong> ‚Äî who brought\nme the things I needed from India</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m well-dressed and properly equipped for this climb because of all of\nyou. üôå</p>\n\n<h2>My Team at <a href=\"https://nfnlabs.in\">NFN Labs</a>\n</h2>\n\n<p>Thank you to my colleagues for letting me take a two-week break and\nbeing genuinely excited ever since I told them about this possibility.\nWe&#39;ve talked about it in our weekly calls, and they&#39;ve stepped up\nbeautifully, picking up the work I&#39;m leaving behind for the next two\nweeks. Having that support and enthusiasm from your team means\neverything. üôè</p>\n\n<h2>My Kilimanjaro Crew</h2>\n\n<p>And finally, the most important group‚Äîthe team that made this all happen\nand with whom I&#39;ll be spending every waking moment of the next 10 days:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajan Mittal</strong> ‚Äî the man who got me into a regular hiking\nroutine in KL, took me to Mt. Rinjani, and now to Kilimanjaro.<br\n/><strong>Rakesh Aravindan</strong> ‚Äî our forex partner and the ultimate\nchill pill of the group.<br /><strong>Wong Chin Wai</strong> ‚Äî our super\nmotivator and the master of fine print details.<br /><strong>Naman\nGupta</strong> ‚Äî the one who gave us serious FOMO in our training plan\nand pushed me to train harder than I had initially planned.</p>\n\n<p>All the best to us ‚Äî <strong>The High Five</strong>! üèîÔ∏è¬†</p>\n",

And except for the Wadi Degla the city has no\nother place to offer. Wadi Degla is a limestone valley which seems to\nhave formed from water flowing ‚Äî whether river or sea is unclear, as\npeople have different stories.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see from the photos below the landscape is the exact opposite\nof what we had in Malaysia. But it has its own charm. You are exposed to\nthe elements ‚Äî wind and sun. On a winter morning, the cold air is bone\nchilling. But it also makes the sun bearable. The walk in the valley\nmakes you humble in the vastness of the landscape visible in front of\nyou. It is a form of meditation.</p>\n\n<p>We intend to make the most of this space (also it is the only one üòã) and\nmake it a weekly routine to explore new trails here.</p>\n\n<div

The only area he was slipping was withholding during playtime at school. And that eventually triggered all of this.\n\n## Notes on paediatric constipation\n1. Constipation is when either child does not pass stools or the stool is very hard and large\n2. The symptoms for this are \n\t- less than 3 bowel movements a week\n\t-  dry and hard stools that are painful to pass\n\t-  bloated with abdominal pains\n\t-  stomach pains that improve after they poop\n\t- traces of liquid or pasty stool in the underwear\n\t- blood on stool\n\t- poops like pellets\n4. The cause for this could be any of the following\n\t- Diet ‚Äî lack of fiber, not having enough fluids, more junk food, lots of daily products (Cheese, milk)\n\t- Lack of physical activity\n\t- Withholding (due to involvement in play or hesitation to use the toilets)\n\t- Emotional ‚Äî Stress in family/life\n\t- Busy children ‚Äî Who ignore body signals for want to play, too packed schedule\n\t- Underlying physical condition\n5. Changes to reduce such occurrences\n\t- Change in diet to include more fiber (Fruits, vegetables)\n\t- Intake lot of fluids\n\t- Get more exercise or physical activity\n\t- Good toilet habits ‚Äî twice a day sitting on the toilet for 10 minutes, approximately 30 mins after a meal\n\nYou can read more about this at the following links \n1.

But I hardly knew about them when I bought it.</p>\n<p>So I was just in the market for some barefoot or minimalist shoes, to replace my current pair of walking/running shoes from Asics. And I want to try on shoes, before buying them. The ones I had in mind ‚Äî Vivobarefoot and Xero shoes were out of question, since they were available only as an online purchase in Malaysia.</p>\n<p>And barefoot or zero drop shoes are notoriously hard to come by here. After a while, last weekend I came across <a href=\"https://www.altrarunning.com/shop/men/mens-escalante-3-al0a7r6m?variationId=445\">Altra Escalante</a> at The Running Lab in Exchange TRX. I really wanted to try it, but they did not have my size.</p>\n<p>After checking out almost all the footwear shops, we aimlessly went into the one belonging to Camper. These Peu Path shoes immediately got my attention and on wearing them, they fit like a glove and it was joy at first try! I wanted another colour, but this one was on 50% off.

				"content_text": "Meet my new kicks ‚Äî a pair of [Camper Peu Path sneakers](https://www.camper.com/en_MY/men/shoes/pth/camper-peu_path-K100886-007).\r\n\r\n![A pair of green sneakers with white soles from a brand named Camper, placed on red floor tiles](https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-7575.jpeg)\r\n\r\nFrom the way I refer to it, you might think I knew about this brand for a long time. But I hardly knew about them when I bought it. \r\n\r\nSo I was just in the market for some barefoot or minimalist shoes, to replace my current pair of walking/running shoes from Asics. And I want to try on shoes, before buying them. The ones I had in mind ‚Äî Vivobarefoot and Xero shoes were out of question, since they were available only as an online purchase in Malaysia.\r\n\r\nAnd barefoot or zero drop shoes are notoriously hard to come by here. After a while, last weekend I came across [Altra Escalante](https://www.altrarunning.com/shop/men/mens-escalante-3-al0a7r6m?variationId=445) at The Running Lab in Exchange TRX. I really wanted to try it, but they did not have my size.\r\n\r\nAfter checking out almost all the footwear shops, we aimlessly went into the one belonging to Camper. These Peu Path shoes immediately got my attention and on wearing them, they fit like a glove and it was joy at first try! I wanted another colour, but this one was on 50% off. It had everything I wanted ‚Äî wide toe box, zero drop and barefoot ethos!\r\n\r\nI later went about reading about the Camper brand and their shoes. Seems like a cool company.\r\n\r\nIt is nice how some shoes find you! So far I am enjoying these Peu Path shoes.\n",

Also it was topped with a generous amount of Butter and spice powders, making it a tempting eat.\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-6482.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Kadak Roomali Roti, a crisp wafer thin bread topped with melted butter and spice powders.\">\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-6479.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"825\" alt=\"A glass tumbler, layered with boiled potatoes, boiled chickpeas and spiced up with chaat masalas and yoghurt sauce.\">\n\nFrom the Tandoor Grills we limited ourselves to just had Paneer Tikka and Chicken Tikka, as we didn't want to fill ourselves before the main course. The Chicken Tikka was really tender and the dry mango powder (aamchur) in its marinade gave it a nice tang!\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-6487.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"A platter of tandoor grilled chicken served with coriander yoghurt chutney\">\n\nBetween the courses, there was a nice performance by traditional Malay dance artists!\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-6485.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Malay artists performing a traditional dance\">\n\nFor the mains, we had the Lasooni Corn Palak. Lamb Rogan Josh and Gosht Dum Biryani. The gravies came with a bread basket. While the palak (spinach) was tasty with the kick of fried garlic, it had something grainy in it like sand, so we just let it be. The Lamb Rogan Josh was just perfect in every way. The gravy was deep red, silky smooth, tangy and spicy. And the meat was soft to the touch. We lapped it up.\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-6489.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Servings of Corn Spinach gravy, Lamb Rogan Josh, Dal and a flat bread basket\">\n\nBy the time we came to the biryani, we were stuffed. We decided to taste just a spoon of it, but ended up having way more! üôà <br>\nIt was one of the highlights of the evening for us.\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-6491.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"A bowl of lamb dum biryani served with yoghurt raita.\">\n\nWe finished it all with one of the excellent Jabeli's I have had in the recent times ‚Äî crisp, not too sweet and mildly tangy.\n\n<img src=\"https://eu.uploads.micro.blog/123825/2024/img-6493.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"A plate of jalebis in chrome yellow colour\">\n\nWe were invited to the event, so we have no idea of the prices of these dishes. But we really enjoyed the food and would highly recommend it!\n\n #DiningOut #MalaysianDiary\n",

Everyone did or does things as a product of their situation and it is beautifully brought out. No one is blamed, everyone is compassionate and everyone is accepting. </p><p>While the quick acceptance all around is almost unbelievable, that the topic of homosexuality is the core of this mainstream cinema and that the macho-man of Malayalam cinema, Mammooty does this role, makes you look past all that and welcome this movie with a smile. Everyone in the cast is spot on, particularly those in role of the father and Thankan.</p><p>Hope the success of this movie, helps more such topics to be discussed in mainstream cinema!</p>\n",
